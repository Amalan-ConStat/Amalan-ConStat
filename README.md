## Hello reader, 
---

I am an R statistical programmer who likes to develop content for statistical theory. My progress in R and Statistics so far:
1. In my undergraduate days I developed an R package ["fitODBOD"](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fitODBOD/index.html) to fit over-dispersed binomial outcome data through various distributions. 
2. I got excited and built a few Rshiny apps for [olympic data](https://amalan-con-stat.shinyapps.io/olympic/) and [south-park(long running tv series)](https://amalan-con-stat.shinyapps.io/southparktextanalytics/). 
3. Scraped data from pdf files and built several [csv files](https://github.com/Amalan-ConStat/PresidentialElection) that include data for the Sri Lankan presidential election results.
4. Hosted my [personal website](https://amalan-con-stat.netlify.app/) through the R package blogdown in netlify. 
5. As a graduate student, I aim to develop scalable methods for Big data related regression problems. 

Go through the repositories in this profile as needed and have fun (also cite).

Thank You.

Best Regards,

Amalan.
