Hello reader, 

I am an R statistical programmer who likes to develop content for statistical theory. My progress in R and Statistics so far:
1. In my undergraduate days I developed an R package "fitODBOD" to fit over-dispersed binomial outcome data through various distributions. 
2. I got excited and built a few Rshiny apps for olympic data and south-park(long running tv series). 
3. Scraped data from pdf files and built several csv files that include data for the Sri Lankan presidential election results .
4. Hosted my personal website through the R package blogdown in netlify. 
5. As a graduate student, I aim to develop scalable methods for Big data related regression problems. 

Go through the repositories in this profile as needed and have fun (also cite).

Thank You.

Best Regards,
Amalan.
